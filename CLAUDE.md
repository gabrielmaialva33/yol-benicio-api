### Project-Specific Context

**Modular Architecture**: The project uses a clean modular structure under `/app/modules/` with dedicated controllers, services, models, and routes for each domain (user, role, permission, audit, file, health).

**Permission System**: Complex RBAC with inheritance, caching, and optimization services. Permission checks are handled via middleware and specialized services.

**Frontend Integration**: Uses Inertia.js for seamless SPA-like experience without API complexity. React components are located in `/inertia/` with features-based organization.

**Authentication Flow**: Custom JWT implementation with refresh tokens, email verification, and role-based access control.

**File Management**: Supports multiple cloud providers (AWS S3, Google Cloud) with presigned URL handling.

**Testing Strategy**: Structured testing with unit and functional test suites using Japa framework.
